### Key Functional Modules

- **Authentication** (`app/(auth)`): Handles user login, signup, and account verification.
- **API** (`app/api`): Defines all backend routes for processing feedback, managing accounts, and interacting with the MongoDB database.
- **User Profiles** (`app/u/[username]`): Each user has a profile page where they can view their feedback.
- **Reusable Components** (`components/ui`): Pre-built UI elements for consistent design.
- **Context** (`context`): Context providers, especially for authentication, allowing global access to user data.
- **Database Models** (`model`): MongoDB models for schema-based interaction with the database, ensuring data integrity.

### Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone the repo, then run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. **Environment Setup**: Create a `.env` file with necessary environment variables (database URL, NextAuth secrets, etc.).
3. **Running Locally**: Use `npm run dev` to start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.
4. **Build and Deploy**: Run `npm run build` for production builds. Deploy using platforms like Vercel for serverless deployment.
